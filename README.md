This project aims to support a large number of connections in a multiplayer online game and is divided into 2 main parts and group :
 - Integration of the ECS FLECS - 5 members
 - A publish/subscribe transport protocol - 3 members
 
 On our side, we are in the process of creating a broker in RUST. This one could communicate with Unreal and ECS FLEX.

DroidRush is a cooperative multiplayer game where 2 players must discreetly escape from a laboratory. Players can help each other with items like a whistle or an invisibility hat.

Currently, we use the null subsystem but it could use STEAM or epic game later

In this project, I was able to create an interaction system with the possibility to drop an item and a session search system like Klems

This game was made during a 7 days game jam where the theme was : **Infection**

Klems is a multiplayer game that allows to 4 players can fight each other with a weapon in an arena that becomes infected little by little. If you are infected, you become a zombie that can only attack in close combat.

In this project, I was able to create mainly the weapon system or the session search system with private sessions (including passwords, filters, etc...)
