This project aims to support a large number of connections in a multiplayer online game and is divided into 2 main parts and group :
 - Integration of the ECS FLECS - 5 members
 - A publish/subscribe transport protocol - 3 members
 
 On our side, we are in the process of creating a broker in RUST. This one could communicate with Unreal and ECS FLEX.
