![Project image 1](https://via.placeholder.com/150x150)

This project aims to support a large number of connections in a multiplayer online game and is divided into 2 main parts and group :
 - Integration of the ECS FLECS - 5 members
 - A publish/subscribe transport protocol - 3 members
 
 On our side, we are in the process of creating a broker in RUST. This one could communicate with Unreal and ECS FLEX.

### 8 members - Finished

DroidRush is a cooperative multiplayer game where 2 players must discreetly escape from a laboratory. Players can help each other with items like a whistle or an invisibility hat.

Each player also has a special skill like a teleporter or a drone.
Currently, we use the null subsystem but it could use STEAM or epic game later.

In this project, I was able to create an interaction system with the possibility to drop an item and a session search system like Klems.

This game was made during a 7 days game jam where the theme was : **Infection**.

Klems is a multiplayer game that allows to 4 players can fight each other with a weapon in an arena that becomes infected little by little. If you are infected, you become a zombie that can only attack in close combat.

In this project, I was able to create mainly the weapon system or the session search system with private sessions (including passwords, filters, etc...)
Currently, we use the null subsystem but it could use STEAM or epic game later.

## <a name="farmthemall"></a>Farm Them All
### 5 members - Finished
#### Tools : Unreal Engine 5, C++

This game was made during the Ludum Dare 52 where the theme was : **Harvest**.

Farm Them All is an agar.io like where you drive tractors. 
The goal is to harvest plantations in order to become more powerful and beat your opponents. It is possible to upgrade your tractor with automatic turrets or missiles. 

In this project, I created the system of breakable structures as well as the plantings. I could also work on the improvements of the tractors like the automatic turrets (EQS) or the missiles.

This game was made during the Spring WonderJam 2022 where the theme was : **It's not a glitch, it's a feature**.
Our constraints was :  "physics-based", "versus" and "course" which was not required but we added in a game mode.

In this crazy game, two players must fight to knock the opponent! Indeed, each player has a stone launcher and constructions to protect himself.
In order to make the experience more fun, we made the noises ourselves and did some cinematics.

The theme has been implemented in the construction mechanics where you can glitch the constructions together to make impressive movements

In this project, I mainly created the building system

This game was made during the Ludum Dare 51 where the theme was : **Every 10 seconds**


Delta Shift is a racing game where every 10 seconds, gravity changes! It is possible to perform many movements such as running, jumping, climbing, sliding or running on the walls.
There are also obstacles like lasers, spikes or crushers.

In this project, I did some moves like the slide but especially the gravity change mechanics. I was also able to create the ghost of the player who reproduces the movements of his best performances
